The course methodology ranges from specific theoretical lectures to a practical approach, composed by discussions and debates strongly focused on what the students need to know to develop in a professional way the role of curators. We will work together in conceiving, structuring and setting up a real project, encouraging and reinforcing specific skills that have to be considered such as: structuring and developing concepts, writing and speaking in public, among other specific workshops. Relevant figures and technics as well as a financial approach to the work will also be considered, in order to cover a global vision of what a curator needs to take into account when curating a project.

The city is compact and accessible and students can expose themselves to all the culture and opportunities that Venice has to offer, becoming locals for one month. The course will dialogue with the city and will give the students the necessary tools to experience events happening in Venice, interacting with the environment, attending openings, visiting exhibitions and enjoying the artistic scene of the city. The next edition of the Biennial will be based on the title \u2018How we will live together\u201d. The national pavilions and other collateral events will be guided by this notion, overseen by several curators who will rethink the spaces and conceptualize the exhibitions to be an ideal set for students to immerse themselves in.
